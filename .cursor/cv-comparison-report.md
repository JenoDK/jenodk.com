  • Summary
    Markdown preview: Full-stack developer with 10 years of professional experience, ranging from enterprise software development to co-founding a successful and growing SaaS startup. My primary language has been Java, but I have worked extensively with modern frontend frameworks (Angular, React) and cloud technologies (AWS and Azure mainly). I actively leverage AI-assisted development tools to accelerate productivity while maintaining rigorous code review and quality standards. I learn fast and am not afraid to ask or answer questions with those around me.

  • Experience - Genohm
    Markdown preview: ### **Genohm** ([genohm.com](https://www.genohm.com/)), Ghent\n*Senior Full-stack Java Developer*  \n**October 2015 - October 2018**\n\nI started at Genohm right after I finished my VDAB course. Genohm was still in the startup phase, which allowed me to grow quickly in both knowledge and responsibilities. The first year I worked on our LIMS system called SLIMS, where I primarily fixed defects and worked on new features. I was then assigned to another project for a specific customer, where I had the opportunity to take on the role of lead developer, replacing our lead developer who was away on a four-month paternity leave.

    Differences: Markdown combines the description into one paragraph; PDF has it split with "My role can be discussed/explained in more detail." inserted. PDF says "4 month" vs markdown "four-month". Markdown includes link to Genohm website.

  • Projects - Fantasy League
    Markdown preview: #### **Fantasy League** ([GitHub](https://github.com/JenoDK/fantasy-league-app))\nThe initial idea was to create a simple app to replace a spreadsheet my friends and I were using for predictions during the World Cup football tournament. It quickly evolved into a full-blown web application where I handled deployment and hosting. The app served around 60-80 users (colleagues, friends, friends of friends) and was maintained throughout multiple competitions.\n\n- **FIFA World Cup 2018:** Java 8 with Vaadin 8 and deployed on a VM owned by my employer of the time\n- **UEFA Euro 2020:** Java 11 with Vaadin 14 and deployed on AWS\n- **FIFA World Cup 2022:** Java 11 with Vaadin 14 but deployed on a bare metal server from OVH (a lot cheaper compared to AWS for what I needed)\n- **UEFA Euro 2024:** Same as WC 2022 but on Hetzner Cloud

    Differences: Markdown includes "UEFA Euro 2024" entry which is missing in PDF. Markdown has GitHub link, PDF just says "(link)". Markdown says "World Cup football tournament", PDF says "world cup football". Markdown says "throughout multiple competitions", PDF says "for every competition and during one".

  • Projects - Bracket Selection
    Markdown preview: #### **Bracket Selection** ([GitHub](https://github.com/JenoDK/bracket-selection))\nAn IntelliJ plugin I developed and maintain with approximately 3,500 downloads ([JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11322-bracket-selection/description)). This was a feature I frequently used while working with Eclipse IDE and missed when transitioning to IntelliJ long ago. Meanwhile IntelliJ has a keybind to replace some of the functionality of this plugin.
    PDF preview: Bracket selection (link)\n\nAn IntelliJ plugin I developed and maintain that has around 3.500\ndownloads, more info here.\n\nThis was a feature I used a lot while still working with Eclipse IDE and\nmissed in IntelliJ.
    Differences: Markdown includes additional context about JetBrains Marketplace link and mentions that IntelliJ now has a keybind to replace some functionality. PDF says "more info here" without a link, markdown has actual links.

  • Projects - Strava Stats
    Markdown preview: #### **Strava Stats** ([GitHub](https://github.com/JenoDK/strava-stats-jeno)) - Work in Progress\nI use Strava extensively but found it difficult to locate past activities, so I decided to build my own solution. Using the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/) and a React frontend, the app provides an enhanced way of filtering through activities. It includes support for location-based search, allowing users to find activities within a specific radius of a location on the map (e.g., activities within 5km of a vacation address in Italy).
    PDF preview: Strava stats (link) - work in progress\n\nI use Strava a lot but found it difficult to find back activities from the past so\nI decided to try to do this myself.\n\nBy using the Strava API and a React frontend the app provides a more\nextensive way of filtering through your activities.\n\nIt even has support to find back activities based on a location on the map,\nf.e. the activity was within 5km of MyVacationAdress 10 city in Italy.
    Differences: Markdown has actual GitHub link and Strava API documentation link. PDF has placeholder "(link)" and "MyVacationAdress 10 city in Italy" which seems like a typo/placeholder. Markdown says "extensively" and "enhanced way", PDF says "a lot" and "more extensive way". Markdown says "vacation address", PDF has the typo "MyVacationAdress 10 city".
