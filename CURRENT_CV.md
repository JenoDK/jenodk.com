## Summary

Full-stack developer with 10 years of professional experience, ranging from enterprise software development to co-founding a successful and growing SaaS startup. My primary language has been Java, but I have worked extensively with modern frontend frameworks (Angular, React) and cloud technologies (AWS and Azure mainly). I actively leverage AI-assisted development tools to accelerate productivity while maintaining rigorous code review and quality standards. I learn fast and am not afraid to ask or answer questions with those around me.

**Responsibilities:**

### **Genohm** ([genohm.com](https://www.genohm.com/)), Ghent
*Senior Full-stack Java Developer*  
**October 2015 - October 2018**

I started at Genohm right after I finished my VDAB course. Genohm was still in the startup phase, which allowed me to grow quickly in both knowledge and responsibilities. The first year I worked on our LIMS system called SLIMS, where I primarily fixed defects and worked on new features. I was then assigned to another project for a specific customer, where I had the opportunity to take on the role of lead developer, replacing our lead developer who was away on a four-month paternity leave.

### **Night shift worker at Volvo Trucks**, Ghent

To earn some money while trying to figure out what to do next, after 7 months I decided to quit and apply for the VDAB course.

## Projects

### Personal Projects

#### **Fantasy League** ([GitHub](https://github.com/JenoDK/fantasy-league-app))
The initial idea was to create a simple app to replace a spreadsheet my friends and I were using for predictions during the World Cup football tournament. It quickly evolved into a full-blown web application where I handled deployment and hosting. The app served around 60-80 users (colleagues, friends, friends of friends) and was maintained throughout multiple competitions.

- **FIFA World Cup 2018:** Java 8 with Vaadin 8 and deployed on a VM owned by my employer of the time
- **UEFA Euro 2020:** Java 11 with Vaadin 14 and deployed on AWS
- **FIFA World Cup 2022:** Java 11 with Vaadin 14 but deployed on a bare metal server from OVH (a lot cheaper compared to AWS for what I needed)
- **UEFA Euro 2024:** Same as WC 2022 but on Hetzner Cloud

#### **Bracket Selection** ([GitHub](https://github.com/JenoDK/bracket-selection))
An IntelliJ plugin I developed and maintain with approximately 3,500 downloads ([JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11322-bracket-selection/description)). This was a feature I frequently used while working with Eclipse IDE and missed when transitioning to IntelliJ long ago. Meanwhile IntelliJ has a keybind to replace some of the functionality of this plugin.

#### **jdump** ([GitHub](https://github.com/JenoDK/jdump))
A small CLI written in Python to easily handle SQL dumps across different projects. I wrote this pretty early on in my career as I kept forgetting the commands and my dumps were all over the place.

#### **JBehave Support** ([GitHub](https://github.com/witspirit/IntelliJBehave)) - Maintainer
A widely used plugin for IntelliJ IDE with 160,000 total downloads. While working at Agilent, I used this plugin in our project and noticed some issues. I created a ticket and submitted a PR to fix it. The PR was approved and merged, but no new version was released, so I contacted the repository owner to offer assistance. This led to me becoming a maintainer with the ability to approve PRs and release new versions.

#### **Strava Stats** ([GitHub](https://github.com/JenoDK/strava-stats-jeno)) - Work in Progress
I use Strava extensively but found it difficult to locate past activities, so I decided to build my own solution. Using the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/) and a React frontend, the app provides an enhanced way of filtering through activities. It includes support for location-based search, allowing users to find activities within a specific radius of a location on the map (e.g., activities within 5km of a vacation address in Italy).

#### **Contributions**
When I encounter an issue in a framework or project, I create a GitHub issue and attempt to resolve it myself by submitting a PR (when contribution guidelines are clear), even if it's just adding documentation.

### Professional Projects

#### **Practle** ([practle.io](https://practle.io/))
*See detailed description in Experience section above.* An educational platform serving 2,600+ users across major educational institutions, focused on personalized language learning with AI-driven feedback.


#### **SLIMS** ([Link](https://explore.agilent.com/Agilentslims))
A very extensive LIMS web application I worked on for 5 years while working at Genohm and then Agilent Technologies.

#### **SLIMS API** ([GitHub](https://github.com/genohm/slims-api))
An API that allows to develop plugins for SLIMS. These plugins allow customers to tailor to some specific needs. This can be an integration with a certain machine (a scale for example) or perform some custom behavior we do not want to have in our main application because it would only be useful for this specific customer.

#### **GeneRead Link** ([Link](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/next-generation-sequencing/genereader-system/generead-link))
This project was built on top of the same backend as SLIMS but a totally different frontend (in Vaadin) because of the customer's needs. Because of the acquisition of Genohm by Agilent Technologies the project was stopped on the Genohm side.

#### **Follow Up Tool**
A tool used internally to follow up medical status of employees at a company. The trajectory of such a procedure is set by law so the app had to be very compliant and strict in its transitions.

#### **Absence Registration**
Used by admins of the customer to register employees who had been absent for a certain amount of time.
